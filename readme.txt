This is a readme for the HTML5 tutorial that I followed at http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/indexeddb/todo/#

It demonstrates how to use an indexedDB to create a local database repository, stored in the browser.  Works best with Chrome and Safari... probably need to test with Firefox to see if this will work in the lab with FFP.
